I've yet again redesigned the site, this time using the very awesome [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) jekyll theme.  Also inspired by fellow STAN enthusiast Michael Betancourt's [website](https://betanalpha.github.io).

Please excuse all boilerplate and 'Lorem ipsum' while I workout the layout.
