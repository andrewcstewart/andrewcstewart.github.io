[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) is increasingly being used for performant implementations of various algorithms, including those used in computational biology. Some examples include a minhash algorithm implemented by [OneCodex](https://onecodex.com/) and a pseudo-aligner by [10X Genomics](https://github.com/10XGenomics/rust-debruijn).

I thought it would be useful to start compiling a collection of these rust implementations as they appear, and so I've started an [awesome-rust-biology-algorithms](https://github.com/SequenceFlow/awesome-rust-biology-algorithms) list to track them.
