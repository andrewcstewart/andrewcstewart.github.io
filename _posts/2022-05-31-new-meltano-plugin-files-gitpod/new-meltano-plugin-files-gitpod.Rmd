Gitpod (https://www.gitpod.io/) is a great tool for spinning up fresh, disposable, containerized development environments built with CI/CD automation.  It's a fantastic development environment for Meltano.com projects.

Getting started with Gitpod generally involves adding a `.gitpod.yml` configuration file to your project, as well as any supporting files (Dockerfiles, docker-compose configuration, etc).

I put together a simple Meltano `files` plugin to add a basic Gitpod setup to a Meltano project: https://github.com/andrewcstewart/files-gitpod
